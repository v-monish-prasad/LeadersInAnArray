Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
PS: The rightmost element is always a leader.

Input
A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]

Output
[17, 2, 5]
Input
A = [5, 4]

Output
[5, 4]
